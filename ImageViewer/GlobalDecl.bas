'Progarm Description
'This is a Image Viewer that enable you to view images from a file or
'images that was placed in an Access database. Images that is placed in the
'access database can be proteced by a security level. Allowing only certain
'users access to that image.

'Functions of File based image

'Create Thumbnails of entire directory sorting out none picture formats
'View each Thumbnail by itself as single image and enable you to enlarge it
'Create a slideshow from a entire directory or from the thumbnails you

'Functions of Database images
'Allow you to place images in database based on dirrent image type
'Image types has three levels
'  First Level  - Image Main Type         -  Transportation
'  Second Level - Image Sub Type          -  Vehicles
'  Third Level  - Image Sub Minimum Type  -  Cars
'Import all images from a directory and place them directly in image types
'that you want.
'Export all images saved in a specific image type to a directory
'Allow you to create Thumbnails of images in database
'Allow you to create a SlideShow from images in the database

'Database is also password protected and not able to open with Access
'Enable you to Create Users and assign a security level to that user
'Create main Image types (First Level) and assign a security level to that
'image type, only user above that security level may then access that
'image type

'Multiple level security system placed in the application allows you to
'restrict access to all major function of the application involved with
'the database.

'Note on Pictures in Database : Due to the fact or the nature of picture used
'when they are saved in the database ( use a OLE Field ) there size normaly increase
'by two. That is why I am compressing the picture.
'If for some reasone I am placing the picture wrong in the database
'plz inform me. Or if you have a better and faster compreesion method plz send
'me a copy
'
'Thank You
